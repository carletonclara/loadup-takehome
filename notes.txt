### Looking at the requirements ###

1. An interface to collect bookings that allows a user to provide:
    a. First Name
    b. Last Name
    c. Animal Name
    d. Animal Types (Dog/Cat/Pig)
        Should this be a drop down? What if we add more? Radio button will not be scalable if we have a bunch of types
    e. Hours Requested (min 2, max 8)
        Message to user describing limit?
        Toggle buttons to add and subtract
        We need a way to directly input as well, it could be annoying to have to keep clicking
        Red outline and message for if it it out of bounds
        Min/Max refs should be easily alterable in the code
    f. Date of service
        How far in the future do we want to schedule?
        Calendar view would be a nice to have
        Date validation?

Questions I would ask product
    Do we want validation as the user goes through the page or on submit? 
    All fields are required?
    Do we want a warning if we exit the page when in progress? 
    Will you need to be signed in to access this page?
    Data deletion time frame?


2. A "pricing engine" to determine the cost of service
    a. Base charge of $20
    b. $20 additional per hour for pigs
    c. $10 additional per hour for dogs
    d. $5 additional per hour for cats

    Make all of the prices ref one var if it needs to be changed in the future.
    Also consider adding more animals in the future
    When do we need to show this? To the user or only in the admin view? 

### Issues along the way ###

- csrf errors for requests
- cors errors :/
- rendering the price on form change seems like it could be inefficient, limited making the 
    request for certain fields but could still be inefficient.


### Nice to haves ###

- price breakdown in PriceCard
- react router
- factories and stubbing setup for specs
